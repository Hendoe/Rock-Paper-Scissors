A basic Rock Paper Scissors App. Currently players can type a command. The 3 obvious ones are accepted, plus one cheat code.

Since this isn't very impressive on it's own, the main goal is to expand it graphically. Having the computer player represented by an animated figure, a countdown, and with a little sound effects. Perhaps an online mode someday as well, but for now it will be a project to return to when I want to attempt implementing basic animation.
